//: Previous [Counting Characters](@previous)
//: ## Accessing and Modifying a String
//: You can access and modify a string through its methods and properties, or by using subscript syntax

//: ### String Indices
/*:
 Each `String` value has an associated _index_ type, `String.Index`, which corresponds to the position of each `Character` in the string.
 
 Use the `startIndex` property to acccess the positoin of the first `Character` of a `String`. The `endIndex` is the position after the last character in a `String. As a result, the `endIndex` property isn't a valid argument to a string's subscript. If a `String` is empty, `startIndex` and `endIndex` are equal
 
 You can access the indices before and afer a given index using the `index(before:)` and `index(after:)` methods of `String`. To access farther away from the given index, you can use the `index(_:offsetBy:)` method instead of calling one of these methods multiple times.

//: Attempting to access a `Character` at an index outside of a string's range will trigger a runtime error
//greeting[greeting.endIndex]
//greeting.index(after: endIndex)

//: Use the `indices` property of the `characters` property to create a `Range` of all of the indexes used to access individual characters in a string.

//: > NOTE: You can use the `startIndex` and `endIndex` properties and the `index(before:)`, `index(after:)` and `index(_:offsetBy:)` methods on any type that conforms to the `Collection` protocol. This includes `String`, as shown here, as well as collection types such as `Array`, `Dictionary` and `Set`.

// ### Inserting and Removing
var welcome = "hello"
welcome.insert("!", at: welcome.endIndex)
//: To insert the contents of another string a a specified index, use the `insertContentsOf(_:at:)` method
welcome.insert(contentsOf: " there".characters, at: welcome.index(before: welcome.endIndex))

//: To remove a character from a string at a specified index, use the `removeAtIndex(_:)` method
welcome.remove(at: welcome.index(before: welcome.endIndex))
welcome

let range = welcome.index(welcome.endIndex, offsetBy: -6)..<welcome.endIndex
welcome.removeSubrange(range)

//: > NOTE: You can use the `insert(_:at:)`, `insert(contentsOf:at:)`, `remove(at:)`, and `removeSubrange(_:)` methods on any type that conforms to the `RangeReplaceableCollectionProtocol` protocol. This includes `String` as shown here, as well as collection types such as `Array`, `Dictionary` and `Set`.

//: ## Comparing Strings
//: Swift provides three ways to compare textual values: string and character equality, prefix equality and suffix equality.

//: ### String and Character Equality
let quotation = "We're a lot alike, you and I."
let sameQuotation = "We're a lot alike, you and I."
if quotation == sameQuotation {
    print("These two strings are considered equal")

let cyrillicCaptialLetterA: Character = "\u{0410}"
if latinCapitalLetterA != cyrillicCaptialLetterA {
    print("These two string a not equivalent")
}

//: > NOTE: String and character comparisons in Swift are not locale-sensitive.

//: ## Prefix and Suffix Equality
//: To check whether a string has a particular string prefix or suffix, call the string's `hasPrefix(_:)` and `hasSuffix(_:)` methods, both of which take a single argument tof type string and return a Boolean value
