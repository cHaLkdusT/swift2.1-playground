 ## Choosing Between Classes and Strucutures
 As a general guideline, consider creating a structure when one or more of these conditions apply:
 
 * The structure's primary purpose is to encapsulate a few relatively simple data values
 * It is reasonable to expect that the encapsulated values wil be copied rather than referenced when you assign or pass around an instance of that structure
 * Any properties stored by the structure are themselves value types, which would also be expected to be copied rather than referenced
 * The structure does not need to inherit porperties or behavior from another existing type

 Examples of good candidates for structures include:
 * The size of a geometric shape, perhaps encapsulating a `width` property and a `height` property, both of type `Double`
 * A way to refer to ranges within a series, perhaps encapsulating a `start` property and a `length` property, both of type `Int`
 * A point in a 3D coordinate system, perhaps encapsulating `x`, `y` and `z` properties, each of type `Double`
 
 In all other cases, define a class, and create instances of that class to be managed and passed by reference. In practice, this means that most custom data constructs should be classes, not structures.
