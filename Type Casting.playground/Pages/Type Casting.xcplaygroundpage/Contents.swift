// # Type Casting
/*:
 _Type casting_ is a way to check the type of an instance, or treat that instance as a different superclass or subclass from somewhere else in its own class hierarchy.
 
 Type casting in Swift is implemented with the `is` and `as` operators. These two operators provide a simple and expressive way to check the type of a value or cast a value to a different type.
 
 You can also use type casting to check whether a type conforms to a protocol, as described in Checking for Protocol Conformance.
 
 ## Defining a Class Hierarchy for Type Casting
 You can use type casting with a hierarchy of classes and subclasses to check the type of a particular instance and to cast that instance to another class within the same hierarchy. The three code snippets below define a hierarchy of classes and an array containing instances of those classes, for use in an example of type casting.
 
 the first snippet defines a new base class called `MediaItem`. This class provides basic functionality for any kind of item that appears in a digital media library. Specificall, it delcares a `name` property of type `String` and an `init` initializer. (It is assume that all media items, including all movies and songs, will have a name.
 */
class MediaItem {
    var name: String
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}
//: The next snippet defines two subclasses of `MediaItem`. The first subclass, `Movie`, encapsulates additional information about a movie or film. It adds a `director` property on top of the base `MediaItem` class, with a corresponding initializer. The second subclass, `Song`, adds an `artist` property and initializer on top of the base class:
class Movie: MediaItem {
    var director: String
    init(name: String, director: String) {
        self.director = director
        super.init(name: name)
    }
}
class Song: MediaItem {
    var artist: String
    init(name: String, artist: String) {
        self.artist = artist
        super.init(name: name)
    }
}
//: The final snippet creates a constant array called `library`, which contains two `Movie` instances and three `Song` instances. The type of the `library` array is inferred by intializing it with the contetns of an array literal. Swift's type checker is able to deduce that `Movie` and `Song` have a common superclass of `MediaItem`, and so it infers a type of `[MediaItem]` for the `library` array:
let library = [
    Movie(name: "Casablanca", director: "Michael Curtiz"),
    Song(name: "Blue Suede Shoes", artist: "Elvis Presley"),
    Movie(name: "Citizen Kane", director: "Orson Welles"),
    Song(name: "The One And Only", artist: "Chesney Hawkes"),
    Song(name: "Never Gonna Give Up", artist: "Rick Astley")
]
/*:
 The items stored in `library` are still `Movie` and `Song` instances behind the scenes. However, if you iterate over the contetns of this array, the items you receive back are typed as `MediaItem`, and not as `Movie` or `Song`. In order to work with them as their native type, you need to _check_ their type, or _downcast_ them to a different type.
 
 ## Checking Type
 Use the _type check operator_ (`is`) to check whether an instance is of a certain subclass type. The type check operator returns `true` if the instance is of that subclass type and `false` if it is not.
 
 The example below defines two variables,`movieCount` and `songCount`, which count the number of `Movie` and `Song` instance in the `library` array:
 */
var movieCount = 0
var songCount = 0

for item in library {
    if item is Movie {
        movieCount += 1
    } else if item is Song {
        songCount += 1
    }
}

print("Media library contain \(movieCount) movies and \(songCount) songs")
/*:
 This example iterates through all items in the `library` array. On each pass, the `for`-`in` loop sets the `item` constant to the next `MediaItem` in the array.
 
 `item is Movie` returns `true` if the current `MediaItem` is a `Movie` instance and `false` if it is not. Similary, `item is Song` checks whether the item is a `Song` instance. At the end of the `for`-`in` loop, the values of `movieCount` and `songCount` contain a count of how many `MediaItem` instances were found of each type.
 
 ## Downcasting
 A constant or variable of a certeain class type may actually refer to an instance of a subclass behind the scenes. Where you believe this is the case, you can try to _downcast_ to the subclass type with a _type cast operator_ (`as?` or `as!`).
 
 Because downcasting can fail, the type cast operator comes in two different forms. The conditional form, `as?`, returns an optional value of the type you are trying to downcast to. The forced form, `as!`, attempts the downcast and force-unwraps the result as a single compount action.
 
 Use the conditional form of the type cast operator (`as?`) when you are not sure if the downcast will succeed. This form of the operator will always return an optional value, and value will be `nil` if the downcast was not possible. This enables you to check for a successful downcast.
 
 Use the forced form of the type cast operator (`as!`) only when you are sure that downcast will always succeed. This form of the operator will trigger a runtime error if you try to downcast to an incorrect class type.
 
 The example below iterates over each `MediaItem` in `library` and prints an appropriate description for each item. To do this, it needs to access each item as a true `Movie` or `Song`, and not just as a `MediaItem`. This is necessary in order for it to be able to access the `director` or `artist` property of a `Movie` or `Song` for use in the description.
 
 In this example, each item in the array might be a `Movie`, or it might be a `Song`. You don't know in advance which actual class to use for each item, and so it is appropriate to use the conditional form of the type cast operator (`as?`) to check the downcast each time through the loop:
 */
for item in library {
    if let movie = item as? Movie {
        print("Movie: \(movie.name), dir. \(movie.director)")
    } else if let song = item as? Song {
        print("Song: \(song.name), by \(song.artist)")
    }
}
/*:
 This example starts by trying to downcast the current `item` as a `Movie`. Because `item` is a `MediaItem` instance, it's possible that it _might_ be a `Movie`; equally, it's also possible that it might be a `Song`, or ever just a base `MediaItem`. Because of this uncertainty, the `as?` form of the type cast operator returns an _optional_ value when attempting to downcast to a subclass type. The result of `item as? Movie` is of type `Movie?`, or "optional `Movie`"
 
 Downcasting to `Movie` fails when applied to the `Song` instance in the library array. To cope with this, the example above uses optional binding to check whether the optional `Movie` actually contains a value (that is, to find out whether the downcast succeeded.) This optional binding is writtent "`if let movie = item as? Movie`", which can be read as:
 
 "Try to access `item` as a `Movie`. If this is successful, set a new temporary constant called `movie` to the value stored in the returned optional `Movie`"
 
 If the downcasting succeeds, the properties of `movie` are then used to print a description for that `Movie` instance, including the name of its `director`. A similar principle is used to check for `Song` instances, and to print an appropriate description (including `artist` name) whenever a `Song` is found in the library.
 
 NOTE: Casting does not actually modify the instance or change its values. The underlying instance remains the same; it is imple treated and accessed as an instance of the type to which it has been cast.
