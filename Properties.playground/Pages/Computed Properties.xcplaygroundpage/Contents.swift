 ### Read-Only Computed Properties
 A computed property with a getter but no setter is known as a _read-only computed propert_. A read-only computed property always returns a value, and can be accessed through dot syntax, but cannot be set to a different value.
 
 > You must declare computed properties - including read-only computed properties - as variable properties with `var` keyword, because their value is not fixed. The `let` keyword is only used for constant properties, to indicate their values cannot be changed once they are set as part of instance initialization.
