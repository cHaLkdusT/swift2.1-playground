 # Subscripts
 Classes, structures and enumerations can define _subscripts_, which are shortcuts for accessing the member elements of a collection, list or sequence. You use subscripts to set and retrieve values by index without needing separate methods for setting and retrieval. Fo example, you access elements in an `Array` instance as `someArray[index]` and elements in `Dictionary` instance as `someDictionary[key]`.
 
 You can define multiple subscripts for a single type, and the appropriate subscript overload to use is selected based on the type of index value you pass to the subscript. Subscripts are not limited to a single dimension, and you can define subscripts with multiple input parameters to suit your custom type's needs.

 ## Subscript Syntax
 Subscripts enable you to query instances of a type by writing one or more values in square brackets after the instance name. Their syntax is similar to both instance method syntax and computed property syntax. You write subscript definitions with the `subscript` keyword, and specify one or more input parameters and a return type, in the same way as instance methods. Unlike instance methods, subscripts can be read-write or ready-only. this behavior is communicated by a getter and setter in the same way for computed properties

//subscript(index: Int) -> Int {
//    get {
//        // return an appropriate subscript value here
//        return 1
//    }
//    set {
//        // perform a suitable setting action here
//    }
//}
/*:
 The type of `newValue` is the same as the return value of the subscript. As with computed properties, you can choose not to specify the setter's (`newValue`) parameter. A default parameter called `newValue` is provided to your setter if you do not provide one yourself.
 
 As with read-only computed properties, you can drop the `get` keyword for read-only subscripts

//subscript(index: Int) -> Int{
//    // return an appropriate subscript value here
//}
//: Here's an example of a read-only subscript implementation, which defines a `TimesTable` structure to represent an n-times-table of integers:
struct TimesTable {
    let multiplier: Int
    subscript(index: Int) -> Int {
        return multiplier * index
    }
}
let threeTimesTable = TimesTable(multiplier: 3)
print("six times three is \(threeTimesTable[6])")
//: > An n-times-table is based on a fixed mathematical rule. It is not appropriate to set `threeTimesTable[someIndex]` to a new value, and so the subscript for `TimesTable` is defined as read-only subscript.
