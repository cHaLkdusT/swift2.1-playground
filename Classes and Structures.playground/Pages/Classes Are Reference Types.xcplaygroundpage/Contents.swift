 ## Classes Are Reference Types
 Unlike value types, _reference types_ are _not_ copied when they are assigned to a variable or constant, or when they are passed to a function. Rather than a copy, a reference to the same existing instance is used instead

 Because classes are reference types, `tenEighty` and `alsoTenEighty` actually both refer to the _same_ `VideoMode` instance. Effectively, they are just difference names for the same single instance.
 
 Note that `tenEighty` and `alsoTenEighty` are declared as _constants_, rather than variables. However, you can still change `tenEighty.frameRate` and `alsoTenEighty.frameRate` because the values of `tenEighty` and `alsoTenEighty` constants themselves do not actually change.

 ## Identity Operators
 Because classes are reference types, it is possible for multiple constants and variables to refer to the same single instance of a class behind the scenes
 It can sometimes be useful to find out if two constants or variables refer to exactly the same instance of a class. To enable this, Swift provides two identity operators:
* Identical to (`===`)
* Not identical to (`!==`)

//: When you define your own custom classes and structures, it is your responsibility to decide what qualifies as two instances being "equal". The process of defining your own implementations of the "equal to" and "not equal to" operators is described in Equivalence Operators

/*: 
 ## Pointers
 If you have experience with C, C++ or Objective-C, you may know that these languages use _pointers_ to refer to addresses in memory. A Swift constant or variable that refers to an instance of some reference type is similar to a pointer in C, but is not a direct pointer to an address in memory, and does not require you to write an asterisk (`*`) to indicate that you are creating a reference. Instead, these references are defined like any other constant or variable in Swift.
