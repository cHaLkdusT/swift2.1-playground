/*:
The _remainder operator_ (`a % b`) works out on how many multiples of `b` will fit inside `a` and returns the value that is left over (known as _remainder_)

The remainder operator (`%`) is also known as _modulo operator_ in other languages. However, its behavior in Swift for negative numbers means that it is, strictly speaking, a remainder rathern than a modulo operation

9 % 4
-9 % 4
-9 % -4
9 % -4
//: The sign of `b` is ignored for negative values of `b`. This means that `a % b` and `a % -b` always give the same answer
